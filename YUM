in sum instances epel repo might be disabled and be annoying getting an error like 
No package python-pip available.
Error: Nothing to do
Since such type error is because the package wasn't found in the default repo and it might be fair to try to disable or repos
and enable `epel` and install

eg.
sudo yum --disablerepo="*" --enablerepo="epel" install python-pip
